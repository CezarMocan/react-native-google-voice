And every day the boy would come
and he would gather her leaves
and make them into crowns and play king of the forest.
He would climb up her trunk
and swing from her branches
and eat apples.
And they would play hide and go seek.
And when he was tired, he would sleep in her shade.
And the boy loved the tree...
very much.
And the tree was happy.
But time went by.

"I want to buy things and have fun.
I want some money.
Can you give me some money?"

I have only leaves and apples.
Take my apples, Boy, and sell them
